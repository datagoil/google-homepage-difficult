Odin Project - build the google search results page - difficult version

This is a project created for www.theodinproject.com. The assignment is to 
recreate the google search results page:
https://www.google.com/search?q=build+this+webpage 
Tools used:
Sublime, Chrome, Firefox, Git, Github, Gimp, Linux, Udacity 

I have limited experience with html and css and probably spent way too much time on this 
simple project but am mostly please with how it turned out. There are a few problems 
I gave up on and are noted on the index.html file as comments. 

I need to cite Udacity.com as a source because I used a project created there as a basis for
this project. The course titled, Intro to HTML and CSS, started with a basic idea of 
box model and simplified bootstrap. This project was layed out with col sizes as a % of the 
page width. See main.css for clarity.
